In August 2019, I joined the metrology and inspection team of ASML in San Jose, CA.

From 2014 to 2019, I obtained my PhD degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Virginia. I worked on biomedical image processing projects under the guidance of [Prof. Daniel Weller](https://sites.google.com/view/dweller42/). My main research interests include image quality assessment, 3D image reconstruction, and biomedical image segmentation. Check more details about these projects under [publications](https://yscylhy.github.io/publications/)! 

From 2010 to 2014, I completed my bachelor's degree with honor in Information Engineering (2010-2014) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Prof. [Weiyao Lin](https://weiyaolin.github.io/).
