In August 2019, I joined the metrology and inspection team of ASML in San Jose, CA.

From 2014 to 2019, I obtained my PhD degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the University of Virginia. I worked on biomedical image processing projects under the guidance of [Prof. Daniel Weller](https://sites.google.com/view/dweller42/). My main research interests include image quality assessment, 3D image reconstruction, and biomedical image segmentation. Check more details about these projects under [publications](https://yscylhy.github.io/publications/)! 

From 2010 to 2014, I completed my bachelor's degree with honor in Information Engineering (2010-2014) from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Prof. [Weiyao Lin](https://weiyaolin.github.io/). 

Highlighted Projects
======

1: 3D Brain Reconstruction and analysis

The high resolution and flexible choices of stains make the microscopy an irreplaceable tool to observe fine brain structures, such as cells. The raw data (~20 brain sections after tissue clearing) of the reconstructed brain on the left is acquired by [Dr. Kapur's lab](https://braininstitute.virginia.edu/kapur), and the red fluorescence of tdTomato reflects the seizure spreading during epilepsy. Visualizing and analyzing the seizure spreading pathway help neuroscientists find out the mechanism of epilepsy and the drugs to terminate epilepsy an early stage. More details about the reconstruction method can be found [here]("./resources/papers/brain_recon.pdf").

The dentate gyrus of adult mice contains millions of granule cells, but only a few hundreds to a few thousands of these cells are activated to differentiate environments. The sparse coding by sparse activation in the mouse brain is linked to the task of exploring new environments. The image on the left shows the activated granule cells in the dentate gyrus. More details about this work can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08864).

2: Cell Counting and Segmentation
------

The dentate gyrus is one of the most active regions in the hippocampus. Numerous brain activities are proved to be related to the dentate gyrus, such as the formation of episodic memories and exploration of novel environments. The image on the left is a zoom-in view of the dentate gyrus. The brain specimens    in this experiment are double stained by the fluorescence of NeuN and tdTomato. NeuN labels all the nucleus, and tdTomato indicates the activated ones. The segmentation method is based on [U-net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).
